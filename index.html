            <h2> About the Artist</h2>
            <p> Noname was born Fatimah N. Warner on September 18th, 1991 in Chicago, Illinois.
                Her career and artistry began in the early 2010s as a slam poet, winning
                3rd place in the Louder Than a Bomb poetry competition. Just a few years later
                she was featured on Chance The Rapper's <i> Acid Rap</i> Mixtape, which is now
                known as one of the best rap albums ever.</p>
                <p> Noname released her own debut album <i>Telefone</i> in 2016, and a second album, 
                <i> Room 25</i> a couple years later.</p>
                <p>Noname is also passionate outside of the studio, spending her time participating in activism.
                    She hosts a boo club that focuses on reading books that are more radical, promoting change. </p>
